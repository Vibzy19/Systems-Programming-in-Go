# A debugger for Go

To understand how a debugger works we would ahve to completely understand how a linux process functions and the states it is found in.
An application has to be executed so that it turns into a process with states and can be loaded into memory for safe execution, with its own stack space to store its data.

###### Ptrace is a kernel hook into the task dispatch logic.

### wait (system call)

* Primary goal of this call is syncronization with its children.
* Whenever a child terminates or is stopped by a signal the parent needs to know.

### syscall.WALL (options)

In the man page for wait(2) we can see that __WALL basically is an option which we set for the wait() where we wait for all the children of the particular process.

### syscall.PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE (options)

* Stop the tracee at the next clone(2) and automatically start tracing the newly cloned process, which will start with a SIGSTOP, or PTRACE_EVENT_STOP if PTRACE_SEIZE was used. 
* A waitpid(2) by the tracer will return a status value such that status>>8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_CLONE<<8))


### The "debug" package

THe debug pacakge at a glance.

```go
    func FreeOSMemory() // Collect garbage and return it to. Usually runs in the background
    func PrintStack() // runtime.Stack // Print stack to standard error 
    func ReadGCStats(stats *GCStats) // GC stats
    func SetGCPercent(percent int) int // ( ratio of freshly allocated data to live data remaining after the last collection ) returns last one
    func SetMaxStack(bytes int) int
    func SetMaxThreads(threads int) int // initial 10k
    func SetPanicOnFault(enabled bool) bool //panic on faults such as runtime memory corruption
    func SetTraceback(level string)
    func Stack() []byte // formatted stack trace of the goroutine that calls it.
    func WriteHeapDump(fd uintptr) // writes a description of the heap and the objects in it to the given file descriptor.  https://golang.org/s/go15heapdump. 
    type GCStats 
```

### The debug/gosym

The gosym package allows us to access the symbol table and line number table embeded in go binaries.


## Progress

* Get the Process to stop executing at the Wait State at every step.
